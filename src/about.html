        I'm a physicist from Universidad Nacional de Colombia. I like science but I like doing 
        things that might be useful for society someday. I've seen that programing brings me closer tomy carreer
        and personal goals. I'm currently working in a satellite driven company,they built their webpage in JS. At the begining I knew nothing about JavaScript
        I began exploring courses and the documentation but it was not enough. After takign platzis courses and doing a lot of research and hardwork on
        my own I've gotten to build this web page as a final project for the asynchronism course. This was a great training for said course because
        I made use of three API's. First I used a country API, provided by restcountries.com , then I used google's API to load the map and finally
        I used world-countries API to call the geoJson file to display a vector image of the country. It's been an amazing journey learning Javascript for the last couple of months
        I was one of those people that thought that programming languages aren't so important and that if you knew how to program in one it would be easy to program in another totally different language.
        But I was clearly wrong, I learned to program first with C++ and then I learned Python. I program nowadays mostly in Python, comming from python to JavaScript shows me how different a language 
        can be, why do I say that? basically asynchronism, it was really confusning at first, because I coulndn't find and equivalent to what I already knew.
        This course was a great tool, but also the documentation is very clear, it has a lot of examples, I also watched a great videofrom Philip Roberts in the JSConf talking about the event loop, and it was one of the most
        enlighting videos I watched about this subject.
